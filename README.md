This program is an argument parser that interprets command-line arguments, and outputs information depending on the flags that are set. A series of pre-made examples are run that run nested functions for each example and determines whether the output of those nested functions is `True` or `False`. Depending on the flags that are set, you can see the output of these test results in the terminal window. Now supports the use of the `-f` or `--file` arguments that take the relative path of a csv file for statistics to be run on the file

## Instructions

The examples are run from `main.py` in the src directory. To run the code, at the root directory, run the following command in a terminal window:

```
python src/main.py [FLAG] [VALUE]
```

For example, to see the results of all the test cases run:

```
python src/main.py -g all
```

To use the new `-f` command run:

```
python src/main.py -g all -f ../etc/data/auto93.csv
```
`Note this flag is not required and uses this relative path as a default`
